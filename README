Beziers constructed from beziers

Beziers are constructed from taking evenly spaced points from two different lines
and successively drawing line segments between those points. This project is to see
what happens when instead of using two straight "guide" lines we use one or two
bezeier curves.

Eventually I'd like to see what happens when you use 1, 2 or 3 bezier curves to
construct a line.
