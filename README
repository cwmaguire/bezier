Beziers constructed from beziers

Beziers are constructed from taking evenly spaced points from two different lines
and successively drawing line segments between those points. This project is to see
what happens when instead of using two straight "guide" lines we use one or two
bezeier curves.

Eventually I'd like to see what happens when you use 1, 2 or 3 bezier curves to
construct a line.

I'd also like to animate drawing a bezier from multiple guide lines.

The demo() function draws beziers using procedurally generated bezier lines.

The demo2() function draws beziers using functionally generated bezier lines.

The demo3() function draws beziers using an even more functional approach.

The demo4() function animates a bezier using three guide lines.

The demo5() function animates a bezier line as well as the guidelines and points
used to draw it. See https://youtu.be/UFSy__xEJ6k.
